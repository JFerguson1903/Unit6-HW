# Unit 6 Homework - Weather Dashboards

## Description

This quiz was created using Bootstrap CSS Framework, JavaScript, jQuery, Font Awesome, Luxon js library, & OpenWeather API.

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create the Weather Dashboard that retrieved data from the third party application's API (OpenWeather API).  It was to run in the brower and feature "dynamically updated HTML and CSS". The user story was that, "AS A traveler, I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly".

The additional acceptance criteria was as follows:

- WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
- WHEN I open the weather dashboard THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
